MBriefX Daily Digest processes only data necessary to generate a private daily summary from accounts I follow. No personal data is sold or shared with third parties. Access tokens are stored securely on my machine/server and are used solely to read tweets. The App does not collect end-user data beyond what is required by X OAuth for authentication. For removal or questions, contact: mariusz.andrzeja13@gmail.com
